title: New File, Again
---

## This is a new file, added on a new branch.

I think the right way to do this is to have everyone add a branch for changes, unless it's just a _simple_ fix.

**Bold text looks like a heading (two asterisks, dummy)**

Thus ends our exercise in adding a new file in a new branch.

+ Create branch (local)
+ Add new file to branch (local)
+ Commit (local)
+ Push (local)
+ Create pull request (GH)
+ Merge (GH)
+ Delete branch (GH)
+ Sync main (local)
+ Delete branch (local)
+ Run Git prune command (local)
